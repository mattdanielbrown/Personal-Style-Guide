# Personal-Style-Guide
Studies, notes, resources, tools, etc. used in the continuous process of building and refining a personal style in designing and coding.

This is intended to be an overarching collection of guidelines, documentation, examples, experiments, etc. that explain and (hopefully) help refine my processes, workflows, habits, and goals in both graphic design, and web/software/mobile development.

## Major Elements Of This Repo

### The main objective is to document, track, and refine how I make things.

#### For coding, this generally involves:
  - how I write code
  - how I maintain code
  - how I deploy code.

*With particular emphasis on*


  - developing / consistently adhering to a code writing style
    - ... and documentation
  - keeping up with and employing industry standard best practices


#### For design, it is much more general and abstract

  - For the most part it will be collections of
    - evolving design styles
    - ... projects
  - studies and practice in:
    - color
    - UI trends
    - etc.
  - Possibly the only concrete component for the design portion will be *how I turn design into code*.
